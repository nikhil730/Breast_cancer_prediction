# Breast Cancer Prediction Model using Deep learning
1) Developed a deep learning model using sequential artificial neural networks (ANN) from the Keras library
2) Achieved an accuracy of 96.90% in classifying breast cancer patients as Malignant or Benign i.e., Binary Classification
2) Scaled and cleaned the breast cancer dataset to improve the quality of the data and facilitate better processing of the data
